#  Distributed formation-enforcing control for UAVs robust to observation noise in relative pose measurements
## Implementation of a distributed formation-enforcing control system for UAVs, robust to observation noise.

This repository contains source code for system that allows UAVs with relative localization capabilities to converge to a desired formation, provided that the measurements are accompanied by a correct observation noise estimate.
The code accompanies a paper submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO).
